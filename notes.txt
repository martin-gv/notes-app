Token refresh in React
Other option:
Make sure to check for infinite loop condition if the 
refresh token API gives a 401. You can maintain a counter 
on every refresh token call. If the number exceeds, stop the 
stream. Then do any error handling on it, for example showing a 
message that there was an error, and logout the user.
